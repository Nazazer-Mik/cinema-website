        problem: `Do you offer e-tickets?`,
        solution: `Yes of course. Simply book your tickets online as usual and you will get a QR code, when you complete the payment.
        Also, you will get confirmation email with all the details and a QR code. If you show this code on your mobile screen,
        a team member will scan your code and you, along with anyone else included in your booking, can walk straight into your screening.
        E-tickets work with Google Wallet and Apple Pay. You may still collect printed tickets before your screening at the counter or kiosks if you prefer.
        If you do so, your mobile-ticket, QR code, will no longer work and you will need to use the collected tickets to access your film.`

        problem: `Can I cancel my booking?`,
        solution: `Yes, if you have a valid WhyNot.cinema account, you may cancel your booking up to 1 day (24 hours) before the performance, provided you made 
        your booking online or via the app whilst logged in to your WhyNot.cinema account. To cancel your booking simply login to your account on the website, 
        then go to your profile page by clicking on user icon in the right top corner, select the ‘My bookings tab’ and select the ‘cancel booking’ option at 
        the bottom of the page. Please note you will not be able to cancel your booking once you have collected your tickets at the cinema. It is not possible to 
        amend a booking so if you want to make a change to your booking, just log in to your WhyNot.cinema account, cancel the existing booking and make a new one.
        The original booking fee is non-refundable. Tickets purchased at the cinema or booked online without using a My Cineworld account are refundable with 80% return
        from the original price of the ticket (only valid if cancelled in time).`
