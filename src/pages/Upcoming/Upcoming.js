                    <h2>What is this survey about?</h2>
                    <p>
                        People like watching new movies, following new releases, while most of the cinemas
                        supports this tradition and are showing only the latest content. Our idea is to say <span className='underline'>  WhyNot </span>
                        to show legendary old hits from time to time! On this page you can find the "Barn on backyard" section below, where people 
                        leave their wish lists. We carefully collect those information, using the AI algorithms to see which movies are wanted the most
                        and carry out it to the top of the page for final vote. Thus, the most desired film is being selected and shown later during the week.</p>
                        <p style={{color: '#f5f5f5'}}>So, <span className='underline'> WhyNot </span> to take part in our democracy community atcivity?
